Switch being a known quantity and very popular they *should* have been expecting a better out of the gate response with their estimates this time.\n\nAlso, Nintendo being Nintendo, was that 500,000 in the first month bavknin 2017 all they could move or was that all that was available?

You could argue console optimization plays a part in that, but the end result is ultimately what matters.\n\n>I’m probably just the wrong audience which is why I don’t understand because I just can’t fathom paying that much extra for a handheld device because of Nintendo exclusives but I’m sure there are people that would\n\nI mean, the lowest end model of the Steam Deck is only around £50 cheaper and that's with a worse screen and no dock included.\n\nAs for the game prices, I mean, yeah, it's a little bit of a piss take but Mario Kart World comes cheaper if you get the console bundle so there's that. And I'm in the UK, where Nintendo is actually much better than most other gaming companies about doing currency conversion instead of just going £ = $. So even MK World is basically just the same price as a lot of the other full-priced games on PlayStation.

Just some compatibility issues to hash out, which is pretty common for backwards compatible consoles.

  "text": "I don’t think my take is nitpicky or reductive at all. The difference between other consoles and a handheld one like the switch is that other consoles sit at home there’s nothing extra that needs to done but carrying around 2 handhelds is something extra. “Just enjoy things as they are” is not a very good take imo because there’s always something that could be improved and since I’m not a developer at Nintendo there is nothing I can do to make it better lol. I wasn’t trying to stir any debate I was just trying to understand and I have gotten a lot of opinions that changed my mind at least somewhat. I could see my take as reductive if Nintendo didn’t do something similar before but the Wii had excellent GameCube support because at the heart the Wii was just a super beefed GameCube. If there plan is to make 98% of games backwards compatible and will improve their selection over time then I will retract my criticism of the backwards compatibility.",

That means that about 98.75% of OG Switch games will work on Switch 2, and that number will rise as some devs issue updates to their games. \n\nBy your own math, you may calm down about any worries about backward compatibility :-D",

Only issue is if your retailer was sloppy and accidentally sold too many, and even then Nintendo are usually pretty good and over-allocate a small percentage to account for that.\n\nI have faith we will both be playing MKW on launch day :)",

I have also never understood of how we improved so drastically in everywhere for consoles but games stayed to a disc for most consoles but Nintendo still allowed for physical to be fully on the cart.

Once Switch 2 only games start coming out I am willing to bet that the average increases. If that ends up being true then 256 GB isn’t going to last long even if the average file size only increases to 30 GB (space for about 8 games after space for OS is reserved). If games end up tending towards 50 GB then you’re easily looking at 4 games and some DLC.",

When's the last time anyone's owned a physical copy of a PC game? \n\n\nEDIT: I know services like GOG exist that offer DRM-free local ownership. I'll concede that's different and a good way to preserve games.

I wanted to get Shadow Generations, but didnt want it digitally. But they didnt make an accessible physical copy for the PS4. So my option was wait it out or get it on Switch where it would run like Crap. So I waited, got excited when I heard Switch 2 would be as powerful as a PS4 and heard it was going to be on Switch 2, now I see it will not be physical and am back to being stuck. At this point, I should say F Switch 2 and just buy a PS5 instead. ",

My understanding is that it was pretty rare for 3rd party developers to have physical releases on Switch, often resorting to download codes in boxes. If this means those same developers are now using game cards over download codes or digital only, then it's a definite improvement, given the cards can be lent and resold. If it means developers who previously did physics not are moving to key cards, obivously that's a big loss.

With the way I play games, there's a 0% chance that I'm paying even $50 for a title. $70 and $80 is completely out of the question. I tend to get really into a single game every 4-6 months, play it nonstop for like three days, and then never touch it again.\n\nThe shit they've got going on is not worth it, and they've even managed to ruin the only series that DOES usually get me to play for longer (Pokemon) to the point where I drop the new ones in less than a day and just go back to the GBA and DS games, or other games in Nintendo's back catalogue that, over the past two decades, they've been trying to trick me into buying multiple times when I already own them.

People just feed them cheap cards, and it’s hard to find a good one that’s as fast as the integrated memory. Usually they are much slower.\n\nAlthough I’d prefer a number versioning scheme, like micro SD 2.0, so we know if a card is a clear improvement over another one, and we have a clear upgrade path after “express” (3.0).",

This is honestly a way better option. Especially when Nintendo wants to stick with their expensive to produce cartridges (anything above ~~64~~ 32 GB gets pretty costly, and even ~~64~~ 32 GB cost them that much that they priced TotK which use it 10€ higher). That's unfortunately too small for modern AAA games. So between going full digital with code only and this I'll pick this. Of course, full physical would be better.",

And yeah Steam will most likely be around a lot longer than access to Nintendo's back catalogue. \n\n\nThen there's also just individual game companies that remove their games from Steam anyways regardless of server availability though. So even if Steam still stuck around devs can still pull stuff off. Not making a defence for Nintendo, moreso pointing out that it's more than just a Nintendo issue.\n\n\n*Unless* Nintendo continues on this trend of allowing the previous generation games to still be playable and downloaded on future generation consoles. Effectively just selling a \"Nintendo computer\". They've never done that before but up until now that's not really been a possibility. But this is Nintendo, if they can figure out a way to make us pay another ~~$40~~ ~~$60~~ $80 on a game we already bought then they'll most likely try to do it.",

It's my understanding switch carts cap out at a maximum capacity of 64gig and the reality is some games are already bigger than that, even for switch 2. Lots of games will need the ability to download their resources as a result.",

The library is still what it is.  PCs don't change generations and there's no concept of losing access to games because previous generations of games reside in shops that are no longer online so you can't redownload something you bought.  Backwards compatibility is pretty good too... about the only thing you have to worry about are really old games that want older OSes and weird shit like that.  I'm comfortable buying shit on Steam as a result... plus, you kind of don't have a choice for PCs anyway.  Physical media for PC died out a long time ago.",

I'd feel more comfortable about it if they would just stick to the same infrastructure, OS, whatever, from now to infinity, so it's always one store, one place, etc, and we don't have these generations that are like a hard reset.  I hope that's the direction that things are going in for everybody.  Switch 2 makes that promising... so far.  We won't know what that looks like until the next generation or two.\n\nQuite honestly, the only thing that's going to get me to fully adopt digital on console is the death of physical media.  I hope by then, we have that kind of shit in place where your library just travels with you from generation to generation and a game you bought 15 years ago just works on the console you're playing now.  I get that physical media has this same problem where you need the older console connected and plugged in to play it, but I'm saying if digital is going to have the same restrictions **and more** than physical does... then I have no real incentive to buy digital and so I generally don't for consoles.\n\nThat's a little different for Switch because it's portable and you have to think about carrying carts with you... that's finally a positive thing for digital and it makes the desirability for digital go up for me as a result.  I don't want to carry carts with me all the time, and so smaller games, I'm willing to buy digital to have a library of stuff that just lives on the console.  Another positive for digital with Switch 2 is that finally, it's looking like some carts will be more expensive than their digital counterparts, and so there's now a pricing incentive that generally didn't used to be there.\n\nWhile this is a fringe case... we now have Ubisoft ripping The Crew out of people's digital libraries.  Sony has ripped movies and TV shows out of people's libraries.  The idea bothers me, and if physical media still exists, that's what I'll prefer probably right up to its death.  But like... again, *real* physical media and not what these game key cards are.  The data is on the cart, I can play it off the cart, I don't need an online connection or service or whatever the fuck to play it or download the rest of it or whatever, and that's it.",

And suffice to say, a lot of us could not afford \"599 US dollars\" in 2006 for the upgrade.\n\nProduction of the PS2 did not end till 2013. That's not a typo: twenty-thirteen! I imagine Nintendo would be all too happy to keep producing the original Switch for as long, if people are willing to still buy it. And since the new game sharing feature on the Switch 2 works with the original Switch, they will have new value.\n\nThat all said, maybe Nintendo should introduce a price cut for the original switch. And a physical copy of Mario Kart World should not cost $90. That's a much bigger threat than Switch 2 launching at $450.",

I'll go back to it soon, but it didn't feel like what the old games did.\n\nWilds was worth it, but I bought it with a slight discount pre-release, and monster hunter is a series that is genuinely better as you follow the title updates, but ymmv on how much you like the series. Good dripfeed content is rather enjoyable to me.\n\nFew games are worth their price nowadays imo. The Zelda games typically are to me, but that doesn't apply for all games. Few AAA games are imo. \n\nBut to each their own. People buy call of duty every single year, and don't seem to mind the absurd price for what imo is a rather mediocre game, and then spend a load on micro transactions...",

It stands to acceptable reason that most Switch owners have owned another Nintendo before, and therefore a fair enough assumption that people who are interested in a Switch 2 likely currently own a Switch.\n\nEven if it’s a biased sample, in this scenario, it’s still probably accurate *enough*.

  "text": "I didn’t “get mad” it’s just true that you’re all spoiled. The entertainment options we have today are not the same as the ones available during the Great Depression, there isn’t any reason at all to think they’d have comparable costs. Despite that, even $80 for a game is pretty cheap when you look at what they used to cost and inflation. If a game is going to have 20 hours of playtime and it costs $80 then you’re just paying $4 per hour of playtime. For longer games the deal is even better. And the cost of entertainment being low during the Great Depression was partly a consequence of the depression, there was less consumer spending so theaters, for example, had to charge less to continue to operate at all. \n\nAnd entertainment isn’t expensive, just the entertainment that you personally want is. There are inexpensive entertainment options, they’re just less entertaining because they aren’t luxury goods. \n\nYou are all spoiled to think that video games are the only product that needs to forever cost the exact same nominal amount regardless of how the economy shifts or how the product changes.",

Traditionally they have gone for the value market so $450 is huge for a Nintendo console, but it's not the most expensive one out now so they can be a little more confident in their pricing without seeming cocky.

I’ve seen them, and talked to them, and read their opinions. And they show bias, like in my example before about how Nintendo made a statement about customers sticking with the old console if they don’t or can’t get the new one. When Xbox said that, it was a mistake and people pointed to it as a reason the console didn’t sell. Nintendo making a similar statement could also cost them in the same way. To think that it won’t or can’t shows denial/bias toward one company. Which is fine like I said earlier, it’s the white knighting and getting defensive over it that’s the weird part. I hope the Switch 2 sells like hotcakes, it’s still dumb to make a statement that justifies *staying put* with your old one. And then weird to keep defending their moves like its nbd, because there is evidence from previous companies where talking like that hurt their bottom line. That pretty much the whole enchilada of what I was trying to say. I’m not sure there’s much more I can do to explain it any better. I appreciate the conversation. Have a nice year. Stay safe.",

The Switch 1 still runs quite a few of the best titles on that platform, which look great for how small it is.

They're prioritizing an experience, something only they can offer. I personally still think games like Mario Kart, BotW, and Portal 2 look great to this day. Yeah, they're no Cyberpunk but they don't look terrible at all.",

If I want amazing graphics, I'll switch to my PC with the $1500 GPU. \n\n\nAll this whining on Reddit, and all you have to do is just not buy it if you aren't happy with it. This isn't just directed at you, but at everyone whining about price and power. ",

  "text": "The specs of the switch 2 are cool for now but what happens when the next gen comes out?\n\nPeople are pretending Switch 2 is a current gen console. \n\nIt is not.\n\nIt's an early Next Gen console. \n\nNintendo sat on the Switch 2 for YEARS just so the C-Suite could chase the \"Most consoles Sold\" trophy. Sucks for anyone that bought a switch within the last few months or got one for Christmas and were not \"in the know.\"\n\nNow the real problem happens when next gen comes out ( one or two years from now) and the consoles can actually handle a mature UE5 game using RDNA4/5. Meanwhile, Nintendo will be on 3 generations old tech that can barely run the raytracing demands of a future title with its 12 RT Cores.\n\nLet's put it this way. When Nintendo cheaps out on hardware, you get 1st party titles that look like Pokemon. Nintendo use to be known for their highly optimized high performance titles. Now, everyone just settles for playable from them. Dropped frames be damned. \n\nThe real question is will the Switch 2 be viable when it hits near end of life around 2031 (2033 if Nintendo keeps the 8 year cadence instead of the six year console release)? \n\nThey had an excuse when they released the switch because the Wii U bombed so hard they were turtling up and being cautious. Why are they being cheap now after the meteoric success of the switch? They are shooting themselves in the foot for no reason outside of \"fans will buy it regardless.\"\n\nEdit: Nintendo hasn't prioritized graphics since the GameCube. Also forgot to mention Nintendo cheapest out on RAM with the switch 2 only having 12GB of shared RAM which will age very poorly.",

If they have any more horsepower it'll drive the cost up. \n\nThat's point I was making even. I always thought people were too harsh on the Switch 1. They were also known for affordability, and decided that wasn't going to be a thing anymore, and decide to charge even more for 5 year old tech, and charge MUCH more for their own games. $80 for Mario Kart is just dumb. Now we also have this weird game key card BS with third party games (at least most of them) that's also invalidating the huge amount of physical sales of Switch games, and the plug an play aspect of their games that is VERY absent with the other platforms. This is also assuming that people who are buying these products have reliable access to Internet with good speeds, which even in the US, we still have areas without reliable internet.\n\nThe whole point of having affordable gaming products is for more people to get into it, and more people can buy them which equals more sources of money. I also understand that Nintendo isn't the only one who has raised prices, but just mean this overall. I would love to see the cost per unit on their hardware myself.\n\nEdit: Yes down vote something sensible. \"Just don't buy it\" has to be the most flawed logic imaginable. Most people who are talking about it WANT to buy it, but can't afford it! Not to mention, action like this never lead to anything with a company like this who is arrogant. WiiU and Virtual Boy flopped because no one actually wanted them, or was marketed extremely poorly.",

Due to:\n\n* A portable console being inherently more useful to own in an unlocked capacity than typical consoles.\n* Nintendo's properties being platform exclusive.\n* Nintendo re-entering—or more accurately *catching up to*—the core gamer market _willy nilly,_ not because the Switch 2 represents an unexpected leap in power (not hardly) but more because core _console_ gaming has been slowing down gen by gen until we've reached the point where From Software is willing to develop a AAA game for Nintendo.\n* That all said, the Switch 2 _is_ roughly on par with a Steamdeck while having a larger and higher resolution screen.  That makes it a _de facto_ choice for emulators and the like.\n* Speaking of From Software, their next Souls-like game is going to be exclusive to the Switch 2.  Come hell or high water, somebody _is_ going to do something about that.\n\nI'd rather not pretend that the combined genius of the hacking community is no match for a hardware market that has a history of being caught with their pants down.",

(Not saying that's the value of the dev's work, just that it's not a franchise I'm super into.) I did order a switch 2, but only because I'm worried about US pricing and availability and because I know there will eventually be new Zelda, 3d Mario, and Pokémon games I'll want to play. I'm not into any of the launch titles except the DK one. That looks incredible but I'm balking at the price for now. I also have zero interest in physical releases that require downloads so I guess we'll see how that develops. I'll just buy the game from the e-shop if a \"game key\" is the only physical option.",

  "text": "Even though it was developed by KT, I counted AoC in there. Echoes of Wisdom was another game that had issues. Paper Mario TTYD Remake, maybe it was an engine thing, but it ran at 30 FPS (Locked, but still) since they focused more on the visuals. Just a few on the top of my head. GF still should be looked at, even if Gen 10 may not look absolutely incredible, Overclocking the OG Switch to its actual factory speeds basically eliminated most FPS issues with SV so while the argument is that GF should be developing with the specs they have in mind, it does show that SV just needs a bit extra power. Not talking visuals here though, but ZA is already a pretty massive improvement in all regards",

There's no magic pixie dust to get massive performance out of less power.\n\nAs we know Switch 2 uses Ampere on an 8nm-class node (Nvidia doesn't transition architectures between nodes as a rule, but maybe it did) and it's based on T239, which has 1536 CUDA cores, we know straight away it's inferior to the almost unlovable RTX 2050 (taking the second testicle off the RTX 3050).\n\nWe don't know clocks, but we know they're not going to be high. Low power Ampere was around 1,300 MHz (Tegra T194, which had more cores). It'll probably have 6 GPCs with 2 SMs each. Memory performance will likely be utterly awful, because that's the nature of LPDDR.\n\nRaw specs, it's going to be around 4 TFLOPS FP32, 8 TFLOPS FP16, and 110 GB/s RAM.\n\n**By handheld standards** it's about double a Steam Deck. We also have Nvidia's reputation here: Nvidia has a very bad reputation in small SoCs. Tegra became such an insult that Nvidia all-but bandoned the brand. It never seemingly recovered after the failure of Project Denver (and the firing of the entire SoC team...) and made few mass-market inroads since, the Switch being one notable exception (and still dogged by very poor GPU performance).",

They also had far more permissive terms for publishing software than Nintendo, who were still imposing various strict requirements on publishers at the time. On top of this, the PlayStation had an existing install base, room to cut console prices if needed from cost savings and a pretty decent library of titles by the time the Nintendo 64 came out. \n\nNintendo probably wouldn't have run into the severe issues they did in getting third parties to support the console though, which would help their performance in the west. Though the management's prejudice towards 2D games would still lose them sales in Japan where, ironically, the Saturn's design legacy making it a sprite-drawer first and a polygon-drawer second made it an ideal platform for things like scrolling shoot-em-ups, 2D platformers and traditional fighting games. \n\nIn turn, that would've stopped the GameCube from being a total bust since it would've given them a better chance of actually having games for the damn thing to launch with and allowed it to come out closer to the PS2, though they'd have to use full-sized DVDs to avoid losing half of their developers to Sony.",

It got blown out in _sales,_ but the actual hardware performance between the two is reasonably competitive, with the Nintendo 64 having things like a Z-buffer (so you don't get the characteristic warping of most PS1 and Saturn games) and a much faster CPU, but you also have memory latency from hell that forces you to write code to minimise read/write operations between parts of the system even when in theory it would be more cycle efficient. \n\nOverall, if the PSX could do it, you could probably get an N64 to do it with sufficient knowledge of how to code for the platform, and vice versa (storage medium limits notwithstanding). It's not like comparing either system to something like the Dreamcast where it's a clear and undeniable slaughter for the fifth-gen hardware.",

If games play identically on the consoles and/or PC then I don't need more than one of them. Like I said Sony does get timed exclusives but they eventually get to PC so I could just wait, Xbox games are just immediately on PC. On the other hand Nintendo has countless titles and series that won't get ported. Going further with the uniqueness of the switch for example having a touchscreen and of course the Joy Cons they're able to create experiences that can't be matched on the other platforms. Unfortunately console exclusivity and unique experience kind of go hand in hand.  \n\nThat being said I do think to the push to multiplatform is bad for the industry and arguably a large part of why AAA are so stagnant. There's no reason to innovate the games. Instead Sony and Microsoft are in a technical arms race to make slightly better hardware than the other that marginally improves graphics over the other.",

That one single variable doesn't account for countless other things that have changed in the past two decades. Back in the 90s the market for video games as entertainment was basically in it's early adopter phase, and profit margins needed to provide cushion because they didn't sell nearly as many games, or devices to play games, services, subscriptions, merch, and all the accompanying sources of revenue that exist now. Not to mention developers had significantly different amount and quality of resources, tools, and proven IP or gameplay elements to depend on.\n\nI completely understand some people are willing and happy to pay $70, $80, or even more on \"upgraded/deluxe\" versions of games, but it's seriously out of touch with reality to assume the more casual audience would be on board with that pricing. I know even with the $60 price tag of switch games I found myself passing on loads of first party titles because to \"try\" a game that I wasn't super into at that price point was not worth it.",

Think Wii Sports, Nintendo land, 1-2 Switch, Astro’s Playroom, etc. Definitely should’ve still come bundled with the system (Nintendo is crazy if they think most people will pay money for that tiny-ass game, even at 10 bucks), but I think the intention is more to provide a gameplay experience that couldn’t be done on the previous system, rather than be a legitimate user guide.",

Until the PlayStation came out they were mainly competing with just Sega.\n\nWith the emergence of PlayStation, N64 ended up slashing fhe prices of most of their games to $60. PlayStation was able to sell cheaper games that looked better and they could price them cheaper since they were put on a disk.\n\nFast forward to 2000-2001. The PS2 and Xbox releases, making even more competition for Nintendo who just released GameCube. Now having to compete with TWO consoles, Nintendo slashes their prices AGAIN for brand new games to $40-$50\n\nSo all the talk of “inflation adjusted” is nonsense Because as time has gone on Nintendo has been able to lower their prices just to have a chance in the market. They can’t compete hardware wise but they’ve been able to hang around because of their price as well as their exclusives.\n\nNow they’re pricing their games at $80. Not just the brand new releases coming out but also the 10 year old games they’re re releasing for switch 2. \n\nAdjusted to inflation or not, any games costing $80+ at any time period is awful and the only way to fight it is with your wallets.

I would wager that retail partners get ~8 to 12 dollars on a $60 game as their mark up not counting manufacturing cost, And switch cartridges cost more to manufacturer then disc games. I am also thinking nintendo raises the price $10 for games above 16GB that need the 32GB card because that is the real common factor between tears of the kingdom and Mario kart world. On switch there were only 4 games released on 32gb carts, Tears of the kingdom, Witcher 3, Final X/X2 (asia only), and dragon quest builders (Japan only). I would not be surprised if going up to 32gb adds another $3 to $5 ontop of the cost of the 8gb and 16gb carts nintendo normally used. And 3rd parties maybe just eat it because porting games like the Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 cost far less than developing new games for nintendo switch/switch 2.",

Playstation needs PS+ for online play. \n\nPCs can do countless other tasks too. If you were to compare with equivalent ability, you should add *at least* a cheap laptop's cost on the PS5 side. If you do productivity tasks as well, now you need a console *and* a powerful PC or Mac. And just building one powerful PC is WAAY cheaper.\n\nPCs can be upgraded down the line with significant savings, because you can upgrade for example only the CPU and/or the GPU, and keep everything else. With consoles you have to sell the whole unit at a massive loss and buy a whole new unit of the new generation. And this most likely includes all the peripherals as well. And also backwards compatibility eith games is not guaranteed. Only *most* of the PS4 games work with PS5, not all.\n\nPS5 itself is a loss leader, sold at a loss to gain profits with PS+, peripherals and overpriced games. So comparing a loss leader without the profit products against a group of products (PC components) that are all priced to generate profit, is definitely not fair. Especially because most buyers of the PS5 *will* buy those other things too. That's why I'd say it's fair to use the 2nd hand PC component prices to compare the two. But I'd go as far that the price to beat should include at least like 4 years of PS+.\n\nSo yeah, I'd say the bang for buck king is PC in the long run, when you account for everything.",

But also, yeah it seems, I was wrong in my initial correction to that other person by denying it be called a luxury good.\n\nHowever, as was you technically wrong in you initial correction. The actual correction to my comment should have been something like \"luxury goods are discretionary ordinary goods\". I suspect its because you didn't know either.\n\nI admit I was partly wrong. Can you? Or will you pretend you actually knew something all along?",
